Laser-Water-Temperture
======================

An Arduino based project using a duel 7 Segment Display with a Dallas DS18B20 temperture sensor using 2 shift registers.

The 7 segment displays used in this project are common anode meaning that the led's share the postive connection; 
This requiremet needs a zero (take it LOW) on the shift registers output which will light up the Led.
